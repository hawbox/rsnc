/** = Description
  * The event responder interface for +HControl+.
  * Registers the events defined by boolean properties of 
  * the events object to the control instance. The event manager 
  * handles the event mapping and abstraction itself.
  * NOTE startDrag vs mouseDown and endDrag vs mouseUp events 
  * conflict, if both are set simultaneously.
  *
  * = Parameters
  * +_events+::  A +{ event: state }+ Object structure, sets events based on the 
  *              keys and the flag. All states are Booleans (true or false).
  *              A true state means the event listening for the event is
  *              enabled and a false state means the event listening is disabled.
  *              See the Event Types below:
  *
  * == Event States
  * Event State::    Description
  * +mouseMove+::   The global +mouseMove+ event state. The component receives
  *                 this event regardless if it's focused or not. The event
  *                 responder method for it is +mouseMove+ and it receives the
  *                 absolute x and y coordinates of the mouse pointer when the
  *                 mouse cursor position changes. Can also be toggled
  *                 separately by using the +setMouseMove+ method.
  * +textEnter+::   The global +textEnter+ event state. The component receives
  *                 this event regardless if it's focused or not. The event
  *                 responder method for it is +textEnter+ and it receives a
  *                 every time a key on the keyboard is pressed. Can also
  *                 be toggled separately by using the +setTextEnter+ method.
  * +click+::       The local +click+ event state. The component receives
  *                 this event only if it's focused. The event responder
  *                 method for it is +click+ and it receives the absolute x
  *                 and y coordinates of the mouse pointer as well as which
  *                 mouse button was used to trigger the event. Can also be
  *                 toggled separately by using the +setClickable+ method.
  * +mouseDown+::   The local +mouseDown+ event state. The component receives
  *                 this event only if it's focused. The event responder
  *                 method for it is +mouseDown+ and it receives the absolute x
  *                 and y coordinates of the mouse pointer as well as which
  *                 mouse button was used to trigger the event. Can also be
  *                 toggled separately by using the +setMouseDown+ method.
  * +mouseUp+::     The local +mouseUp+ event state. The component receives
  *                 this event only if it's focused. The event responder
  *                 method for it is +mouseUp+ and it receives the absolute x
  *                 and y coordinates of the mouse pointer as well as which
  *                 mouse button was used to trigger the event. Can also be
  *                 toggled separately by using the +setMouseUp+ method.
  * +mouseWheel+::  The local +mouseWheel+ event state. The component receives
  *                 this event only if it's focused. The event responder
  *                 method for it is +mouseWheel+ and it receives the delta of
  *                 the amount of the mouse scroll wheel was rolled: a floating
  *                 point number, larger or smaller than 0, depending on the
  *                 direction the scroll wheel was rolled. Can also be
  *                 toggled separately by using the +setMouseWheel+ method.
  * +draggable+::   The local +draggable+ event states. The component receives
  *                 these events only if it's focused. The event responders
  *                 methods are +startDrag+, +drag+ and +endDrag+. The events
  *                 receive the mouse cursor coordinates.
  *                 Can also be toggled separately by using the +setDraggable+
  *                 method.
  * +droppable+::   The local +droppable+ event states. The component receives
  *                 this event only if another component is dragged (hovered)
  *                 or dropped with the area of this component as the target.
  *                 The event responders method for it are +hoverStart+,
  *                 +drop+ and +hoverEnd+.
  *                 Can also be toggled separately by using the
  *                 +setDroppable+ method.
  * +keyDown+::     The local +keyDown+ event state. The component receives
  *                 this event only if it's focused. The event responder
  *                 method for it is +keyDown+ and it receives the ascii key
  *                 code whenever a keyboard key is pressed. Can also be
  *                 toggled separately by using the +setKeyDown+ method.
  *                 Also supports special mode 'repeat', when listening to
  *                 key repetitions is needed.
  * +keyUp+::       The local +keyUp+ event state. The component receives
  *                 this event only if it's focused. The event responder
  *                 method for it is +keyUp+ and it receives the ascii key
  *                 code whenever a keyboard key is released. Can also be
  *                 toggled separately by using the +setKeyUp+ method.
